# [An Introduction to Observability](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2023/01/09/an-introduction-to-observability/)
I found this article interestesing because it talks about one of the rapidly growing areas of software engineering today: Observability. There are many companies offering products that enable observability, and the practice generally refers to monitoring software to track changes, performance, etc â€“ before anything has enough of an effect that it might impact customers downstream.
The article breaks down observability into each of its parts in order to fully explain what observability is and looks like. After reading, I came away with a newfound appreciation of what it means to "implement observability" in your software engineering practice.

## Khalifa AlFalasi's comments:

I agree with the comments made above. According to the article, there are subtle differences between the concepts of "monitoring" and "observability" that I was unaware of. Primarily, the former responds to an event after it has occurred whereas the latter can detect problems before they occur. I find observability really useful and fascinating.
